_-What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?_<br>
The use case for this course was to start working on a project for ABC University (ABCU). ABCU is looking for software that will help their computer science advisors access course information for students.<br>
_-How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand._<br>
The initial analysis was directed at selecting an optimal data structure for the project.  The structures that were in the analysis were vectors, hash tables, and a binary search tree.  Pseudocode for each was written and a time complexity analysis was completed to select one structure for the project.<br>
This type of approach is necessary to ensure that performance optimization, data integrity and security, code maintainability, scalability, resource usage, algorithm efficiency, and effective data management can all be addressed and designed for in an application.<br>
_-How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?_<br>
The hash table consideration required and allowed me to spend time researching various approaches and design considerations to make the code and the application efficient and easier to develop.  I took an unconventional approach, using a sorted map to implement the hash table.  I found the solution to be straightforward in coding and overall efficient for the design requirement of providing a sorted list.  It was a specific solve for a specific requirement.<br>
_-How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?_<br>
I normally develop code with a code architecture and data architecture already in mind, and will over time, refactor the entire approach as required. The algorithmic approach can normally be determined during the architecture development process and I have moved to doing more front analysis there.<br>
_-How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?_<br>
I tend to design in outline form and code from that.  The pseudocode emphasis was interesting to me in that it helped me follow the prescribed code architecture and develop documentation at the same time.   I have modified my documentation approach going forward.<br>
